Fizzing and Buzzing for fun and profit.

## What is it?!
[FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz#Programming_interviews) is one of most challenging programming problems of the modern
computing age. Long has its obscure solution eluded even the most seasoned software development veterans. However, through sheer 
determination and force of will, the secrets of FizzBuzz have finally been unlocked! In the spirit of collaboration and Open Source 
Software, I present them here in many of the various programming languages with which I have some exposure.

## Why would you do this?
Why not? FizzBuzz is a trivial question, but it can be a fun introduction to control structures and I/O in a language with which youâ€™re 
just becoming acquainted. As to why I would commit it to some central repository - if a commit falls in a repo but no recruiter was 
there to see it, does it flip any bits?
